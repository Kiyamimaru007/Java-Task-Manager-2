# Java-Task-Manager-2

This project was for a capstone project. It is a work manager for a construction company. 
This program allows the user to add, edit and remove projects from the database. 
The program also moves the completed projects to a different database. 
The database used here was a MySQL database. It made for easy management of projects.
The project was coded in Java and I used the Eclipse IDE to work on it.
